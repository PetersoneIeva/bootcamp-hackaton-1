 Hackaton website
 
<p>We have created a simple website according to given instructions:</p> 
<p>Create landing site for a startup that contains following pages: </p>
<ul>
 <li>About Us</li>
 <li>Pricing</li>
 <li>Registration</li>
 <li>Login</li>
</ul>

<p>Style and any additional functionality or pages was a part of the creative thinking process. </p>

<p>Site have been created as a learning tool therefore corrections from bootcamp non-related people will not be revieved or implemented in the code. </p>

<p>We are self-aware that the code has major and minor flaws and multiple things could be improved.</p>
