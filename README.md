# bootcamp-hackaton-1
 Hackaton website
 
We have created a simple website according to given instructions: 
Create landing site for a startup that contains following pages: 
*About Us
*Pricing
*Registration
*Login

Style and any additional functionality or pages was a part of the creative thinking process. 

Site have been created as a learning tool therefore corrections from bootcamp non-related people will not be revieved or implemented in the code. 

We are self-aware that the code has major and minor flaws and multiple things could be improved.
